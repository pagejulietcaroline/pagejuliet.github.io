        <p><FONT SIZE=1>I don't have many ideas about what this web page could be for, so I'll use this empty space to write about myself in case that is ever useful.<br> I like cats. That is my hobby.  At the moment I am too busy to use energy for doing things I enjoy because school makes me too busy.  Watching cat reels on instagram and scrolling on pet finder are ways it sort of feels like a hobby, but I look forward to when I can continue activities that are meaningful to me.  When I'm not doing work I am with my best friend H. Her name has a moderate to high number of letters. Because we're always together, we don't chat up a storm 24/7.  We “parallel play” when we aren't having a conversation which I have learned makes me a much happier person.  I'll explain parallel play in case you haven't heard it before.  Parallel playing is like having a study buddy who is doing work from a different class, except the playing in parallel happens with any kind of activity.  And I mean any kind of activity.  Jokes.  There is a limit.   Okay that is all I can think of right now, bye byeeeee.</p>

    <p><FONT SIZE=2>Below is an example of how I characterize music I like into categories. The categories are based on a combination of what they do for me and the genre.</FONT></p>
